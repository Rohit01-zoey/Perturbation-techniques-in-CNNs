# Task 1
1. Figure out back propagation - mathematically
2. Understand weight propagation
3. Find out the algorithm(software) for WP


# Task 2
## Problems faced
1. WP not working properly since weight update is not working properly.
2. No benchmark present to compare with

## Ways forward
1. First : Have a control structure-block diagram- for each block of code along with *checks or validation*
2. Check for weight update - from a benchmark that is BP -
