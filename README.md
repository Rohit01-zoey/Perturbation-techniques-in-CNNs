# Perturbation-techniques-in-CNNs
<p>Backpropagation is a technique used in machine learning models which is fast and powerful. However it usually requires very precise calculation power which is not always possible.</p>
<p>To solve this constraint, we implement perturbation techniques in our CNN model. This includes **weight perturbation** and **node perturbation**. These techniques have been found out to be slower however use up very less computing power. As a result, these can be implemented on-chip.</p>
